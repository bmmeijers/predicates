geompreds - A Python wrapper for 2D predicates of Jonathan Richard Shewchuk

    Many computational geometry applications use numerical tests known as the 
    orientation and incircle tests. The orientation test determines whether a point
    lies to the left of, to the right of, or on a line or plane defined by other
    points. The incircle test determines whether a point lies inside, outside, or
    on a circle defined by other points.

Installation
------------

- Download the source
- Run `python setup.py install` (or `python setup.py develop`)
- Run `python test/test_predicates.py` to run the tests.


Usage
-----

>>> from geompreds import orient2d, incircle

>>> orient2d( (0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 10)) # left turn (positive), looking from above
100.0
>>> orient2d( (0, 0), (10, 0), (20, 0)) # straight (zero)
0.0
>>> orient2d( (0, 0), (10, 0), (10, -10)) # right turn (negative), looking from above
-100.0

>>> incircle((0,0), (10,0), (0,10), (0,10)) # on boundary
0.0
>>> incircle((0,0), (10,0), (0,10), (1,1)) # inside, value positive
1800.0
>>> incircle((0,0), (10,0), (0,10), (-100,-100)) # outside, value negative
-2200000.0
