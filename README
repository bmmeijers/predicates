geompreds - A Python wrapper for 2D predicates of Jonathan Richard Shewchuk


Installation
------------

- Download the source
- Run `python setup.py install` (or `python setup.py develop`)


Usage
-----

Many computational geometry applications use numerical tests known as the 
orientation and incircle tests. The orientation test determines whether a point
lies to the left of, to the right of, or on a line or plane defined by other
points. The incircle test determines whether a point lies inside, outside, or
on a circle defined by other points.

    >>> from geompreds import orient2d, incircle
    >>> orient2d( (0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 10)) # left turn, looking from above
    100.0
    >>> orient2d( (0, 0), (10, 0), (20, 0)) # straight
    0.0
    >>> orient2d( (0, 0), (10, 0), (10, -10)) # right turn, looking from above
    -100.0

    >>> incircle((0,0), (10,0), (0,10), (0,10)) # on boundary
    0.0
    >>> incircle((0,0), (10,0), (0,10), (1,1)) # inside, value positive
    1800.0
    >>> incircle((0,0), (10,0), (0,10), (-100,-100)) # outside, value negative
